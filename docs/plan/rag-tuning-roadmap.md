# Preferred-guide RAG tuning roadmap

**Status:** Research complete (July 2026) — not implemented  
**Audience:** Future agents and maintainers planning RAG quality work  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-22  
**Related:** [preferred-guide.md](../preferred-guide.md), [embedding-models.md](../embedding-models.md), `lib/guide-rag.ts`, `lib/chunk-guide.js`

## Purpose

Capture research-backed recommendations for preferred-guide RAG quality:
chunk size, retrieval count (`RETRIEVE_K`), similarity gate (`GUIDE_HIT`), and
whether to add learned routers vs off-the-shelf rerankers. Use this doc when
scoping the next RAG update; it does **not** change runtime behaviour.

## Current baseline (shipped)

| Knob | Location | Value | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Chunk target | `lib/chunk-guide.js` `TARGET_CHARS` | ~500 tokens (~2000 chars) | Structure-aware split (headings, rules, paragraphs) |
| Overlap | `lib/chunk-guide.js` `OVERLAP_CHARS` | ~15% of chunk | Overlap tail on boundary flush |
| Retrieve K | `lib/guide-rag.ts` `RETRIEVE_K` | 5 | Per-guide filter first, then exact cosine sort |
| Hit threshold | `lib/guide-rag.ts` `GUIDE_HIT` | 0.35 | Hand-tuned; skip Tavily when `topSimilarity >= GUIDE_HIT` |
| Embed model | `lib/embed.ts` | `text-embedding-3-large` @ 1024-dim | Sumopod OpenAI-compatible API |
| Router | — | Cosine threshold only | No cross-encoder, no hybrid BM25, no learned router |
| Corpus scale | `match_guide_chunks` RPC | Tens of chunks per guide URL/bundle | Not million-doc ANN search |

**On RAG hit:** up to 5 chunks (~2.5k tokens of guide text) marked `preferred: true`;
tiered web search is skipped.

**On RAG miss:** top 1 chunk kept as weak hint + Tavily/Serper fallback.

**Calibration:** `RAG_DEBUG=1` logs `[rag-calibrate] hit=… top=… scores=[…]` per query
(see [embedding-models.md](../embedding-models.md) migration checklist).

## Game-guide query profile

Player questions fall into two patterns; chunk/K tuning should be judged on both:

| Pattern | Example | Retrieval need |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Lookup** | "Where is the fire flower?" | High precision, smaller effective chunks help |
| **Procedural** | "How do I beat Ganon phase 2?" | Local step context; 400–512 token chunks |

Sources are semi-structured walkthroughs (GameFAQs headings, numbered sections).
The existing structure-aware chunker matches this better than naive fixed-token splits.

---

## Research summary (2025–2026)

Condensed from industry playbooks and papers; not gospel — **evaluate on your traces**.

### Chunk size

- **Default band:** 384–512 tokens for technical docs and walkthroughs.
- **Smaller (128–256):** better for factoid/FAQ lookup; can break multi-step procedures.
- **Larger (512–1024):** better when answers need narrative context across sentences.
- **Overlap:** mixed results. One systematic study found overlap often adds indexing
  cost without measurable QA gain; game guides with hard section boundaries may still
  benefit from ~10–15% overlap at step boundaries.
- **Context cliff:** retrieved context quality can degrade when total injected context
  grows large (~2.5k+ tokens in some studies). Relevant because `RETRIEVE_K=5` ×
  ~500 tokens ≈ 2.5k on a full hit.

- [Optimizing RAG Chunk Size (ML+)](https://machinelearningplus.com/gen-ai/optimizing-rag-chunk-size-your-definitive-guide-to-better-retrieval-accuracy/)

### Retrieval count (K)

- **Small per-corpus retrieval (this app):** sending **3–5** chunks to the LLM is
  standard when the candidate set is already filtered to one guide (~dozens of rows).
- **Two-stage pattern:** retrieve **15–20** candidates, **rerank to 3–5** for the
  LLM when using a cross-encoder. Overfetch only pays off with a second-stage ranker.
- Raising K without reranking mostly adds duplicate/overlapping sections, not recall,
  because `guide_url` / `guide_bundle` btree filter already shrinks the search space.

### Similarity threshold vs reranking

- **Bi-encoder cosine** (current): fast, good for recall within a small guide set.
  Absolute thresholds (like `GUIDE_HIT`) are **model- and corpus-specific**; there is
  no universal constant for `text-embedding-3-large`.
- **Industry trend:** prefer **top-k ranking** or a **cross-encoder reranker** over a
  hard cosine cutoff for deciding relevance.
- **Cross-encoder rerankers** (Cohere Rerank API, `ms-marco-MiniLM`, etc.): typical
  +10–25% precision on reranked candidates; ~100–200ms for ~50 pairs on CPU. Use
  **after** vector retrieval, not instead of it.

- [Reranking for RAG guide (Ailog)](https://app.ailog.fr/en/blog/guides/reranking)

### Learned routers (RAGRouter, LTRR, etc.)

- **Learned query routers** pick among multiple retrievers or LLM backends. Useful
  when you have **several retrieval strategies** or models with different strengths.
- **Not recommended now:** GameGuideGo has one bi-encoder path + web fallback. A
  trained router adds labeling, retraining, and ops without solving the main failure
  mode (wrong chunk ranked high within the same guide).

## Verdict for GameGuideGo

### Keep as-is for now (low risk)

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Chunk size | **~400–512 tokens** — current ~500 is appropriate |
| Splitting | **Structure-aware** (`chunk-guide.js`) — keep |
| Overlap | **10–15%** — keep unless eval shows boundary noise |
| `RETRIEVE_K` | **5** (try **3** if answers feel bloated or noisy) |

### Calibrate, don't guess

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| `GUIDE_HIT` | **Must be calibrated on real traces** with `RAG_DEBUG=1`. Expect a band
  roughly **0.30–0.45** for bi-encoders, but only your score clusters matter. |

### Best next upgrade (highest ROI)

**Do not** build a custom trained router yet.

**Do** consider, in order:

1. **Cross-encoder rerank** — `match_guide_chunks` with `LIMIT 15–20`, rerank to
   top 3–5, route on reranker score (soften or replace `GUIDE_HIT`).
2. **Hybrid BM25 + vector** — helps boss names, item IDs, acronyms embeddings miss.
3. **Parent–child chunks** — small children for retrieval, larger parent context for
   Gemini (best long-term fit for walkthroughs; more engineering than a knob tweak).

### Do not prioritize yet

- Fine-tuned embedding model on game guides
- Full learned RAGRouter-style routing
- Semantic chunking at ingest (cost/latency; structure-aware split is good enough)
- Raising `RETRIEVE_K` above 5 without a reranker

## Calibration results (2026-07-22)

First real run via `npm run eval:rag` — Suikoden 1 single-page guide, 6 in-guide +
4 off-guide, questions in casual Indonesian (real user distribution).

| Signal | Result | Read |
|--------|--------|------|
| in-guide top-sim | 0.28–0.42 (median 0.39) | Low + compressed (cross-lingual: ID question vs EN guide) |
| off-guide top-sim | 0.03–0.09, except one game-topic Q at **0.348** | Non-game separates cleanly; same-domain wrong-game does not |
| `GUIDE_HIT` ceiling | ~90% at any single cutoff | Threshold is **not** the lever; overlap is structural |
| Retrieval recall@5 | **6/6 in top-K** | Right paragraph is always retrieved |
| Retrieval rank-1 | **3/6** | …just mis-ordered (misses at rank 2–4) |

**Conclusion:** recall is solved (100% @ K=5); the failure is **ranking + routing**.
This is the textbook cross-encoder rerank case:

- **Phase C (rerank) is the fix, and likely sufficient.** Reranking the already-retrieved
  top-K pushes the right chunk to rank 1 AND gives a relevance score that can reject the
  same-domain wrong-game query (0.348) that a raw cosine cutoff can't.
- **Phase D (hybrid BM25) downgraded.** Earlier hypothesis was that exact names
  ("Sylvina", "Armor Shop") were missed by embeddings — the data disproves it: they're
  in top-K (rank 3–4), just not rank 1. Rerank handles ranking; BM25 only worth it if a
  later eval shows recall misses (paragraph absent from top-K).
- **Phase E (parent–child) not indicated** — no "right section, wrong steps" symptom seen.

**Caveats:** small sample (n=10), one guide, one language. Re-run on 2–3 guides before
treating the `GUIDE_HIT` ceiling as final. Since recall@5 = 100%, a v1 reranker can
score the existing top-5 — no need to raise the SQL `LIMIT` to 15–20 yet.

---

## `GUIDE_HIT` calibration procedure

Use before changing the constant or removing it.

1. Set `RAG_DEBUG=1` in `.env.local`, run `npm run dev`.
2. Ingest one guide you know well (single page + one multi-page bundle if possible).
3. Ask **~10 in-guide** questions (clearly covered by the pasted guide).
4. Ask **~10 off-guide** questions (different game, vague, or unrelated topic).
5. Read `[rag-calibrate] hit=… top=… scores=[…] top_chunk=…` in the server log.
6. Identify two clusters: relevant (high) vs irrelevant (low).
7. Set `GUIDE_HIT` **between** the clusters (or plan reranker migration if clusters overlap).
8. Re-run a subset to confirm hit/miss matches intent.
9. Unset `RAG_DEBUG` when done (harmless to leave on in dev).

**Failure modes to watch:**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Knob / fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Answers ignore guide despite paste | `GUIDE_HIT` too low, or wrong chunk at rank 1 | Raise threshold or add reranker |
| Web search skipped but answer wrong | `GUIDE_HIT` too high, or wrong-game guide | Lower threshold; reranker margin check |
| Right section, wrong steps | Chunk boundary split a procedure | Overlap or parent–child chunks |
| Misses exact item/boss name | Embedding-only retrieval | Hybrid BM25 |
| Same-series wrong game guide wins | Similar embedding scores | Reranker + prompt guardrails (existing) |

## Proposed phased plan (future PRs)

Use as a starting backlog; each phase should pass `npm run check` and include
before/after notes from the calibration set.

### Phase A — Measure (no behaviour change) — HARNESS SHIPPED

Tooling landed (2026-07-22); the eval run itself still needs to be done by a
maintainer with the guides ingested:

- [x] Dev-only probe `app/api/rag-eval/route.ts` — returns raw top-K similarity
  scores for one `(guideUrls, query)` pair (404 in prod). Adds `scores?: number[]`
  to `GuideRagResult` in `lib/guide-rag.ts`.
- [x] Replay harness `scripts/rag-calibrate.mjs` (`npm run eval:rag`) — splits
  in-guide vs off-guide clusters, recommends `GUIDE_HIT`, reports per-rank score
  decay for `RETRIEVE_K`. Self-check: `node scripts/rag-calibrate.mjs --selftest`.
- [x] Eval-set template `docs/plan/rag-eval-set.example.jsonl` (real set is
  gitignored — may hold private guide URLs).
- [ ] **Run it:** fill `docs/plan/rag-eval-set.jsonl` with 10+ in-guide + 10+
  off-guide rows for guides you ingested, then `npm run eval:rag`.

### Phase B — Tune constants (needs the Phase A run) — DONE

- [x] Ran calibration; `GUIDE_HIT` kept at 0.35 (data showed threshold is not the
  lever — see Calibration results above).
- [x] `RETRIEVE_K` kept at 5 (targeted paragraph often ranks 2–3; overfetch helps
  until rerank lands).
- [x] Updated the `GUIDE_HIT` + `RETRIEVE_K` comments in `lib/guide-rag.ts` with
  the calibration date and reasoning.

### Phase C — Rerank (DONE 2026-07-22: Cohere, opt-in)

Final state: **cosine is the default (free); Cohere rerank-v3.5 is the proven
upgrade, gated on `COHERE_API_KEY` presence.** The Gemini LLM-reranker that was
tried first is deleted — it regressed vs cosine.

3-way A/B on the calibration set (`RAG_EVAL_DELAY_MS=6500` dodges the trial's
10 req/min rate limit):

| Provider | Routing accuracy | Retrieval rank-1 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Cosine (baseline, default) | 9/10 | 3/6 |
| Gemini LLM-rerank (deleted) | 8/10 | 3/6 |
| **Cohere rerank-v3.5** | **10/10** | **6/6** |

Cohere fixed both failure modes: every targeted paragraph moved to rank 1, and its
`relevant` verdict caught the low-cosine in-guide (Valeria) AND rejected the
same-domain wrong-game query (Sephiroth) without dropping any legit in-guide.
`COHERE_RELEVANCE_MIN=0.3` separated cleanly. Gemini 2.5 Flash with
`thinking_budget:0` was a poor reranker (verdict too strict, ordering ≈ cosine).

**Wiring** (`lib/guide-rerank-cohere.ts` + `lib/guide-rag.ts`):

- Enabled purely by `COHERE_API_KEY` being set — no `RERANK_PROVIDER` flag. Unset =
  cosine. Matches "just swap the key" — set a paid key later, no code change.
- Fully **fail-open**: any Cohere error (trial expired, 429 rate-limit, network)
  returns null → cosine `GUIDE_HIT`. Safe to leave enabled on the trial key.
- `COHERE_RELEVANCE_MIN` (default 0.3) routes low-relevance tops to web fallback;
  `COHERE_RERANK_MODEL` (default `rerank-v3.5`).

**Cost note:** trial keys are free but non-commercial + 10 req/min. Fine for
dev/testing; for production, move to a paid Cohere key (1000 req/min) — swap
`COHERE_API_KEY` only.

Recall@5 was already 100%, so the reranker scores the existing top-5 — no SQL
`LIMIT` bump to 15–20 needed. Jina/Voyage would drop in the same way (new adapter
returning `RerankResult`, add a branch in the `guide-rag.ts` gate).

### Phase D — Hybrid retrieval (DEFERRED — data does not justify yet)

Calibration disproved the original motivation (exact names were NOT missed — they
were in top-K, just mis-ranked, which rerank fixes). Revisit only if a later eval
on more guides shows genuine recall misses (targeted paragraph absent from top-K).

- [ ] Add BM25 (or Postgres `tsvector`) on `chunk_text` scoped to `guide_url`.
- [ ] Merge vector + keyword hits (RRF or simple union) before rerank.

### Phase E — Parent–child chunks (DEFERRED — no symptom observed)

No "right section, wrong steps" failures in calibration. Revisit if procedural
answers start losing multi-step context across chunk boundaries.

- [ ] Index small child chunks; store parent section text or parent chunk id.
- [ ] Retrieve children, inject parent context into `buildPrompt` sources.

## Cost / latency notes

| Path | Cost | Latency |
|------|------|---------|
| Current hit (5 chunks, no Tavily) | ~2.5k guide tokens + 2 Gemini calls | Lowest search cost |
| Current miss | Embed query + 1 chunk + up to 4 Tavily calls | Higher |
| + Reranker | +1 rerank API call on 15–20 pairs (~100–200ms) | Small add |
| + Higher K without rerank | More guide tokens to Gemini | Usually worse quality/$ |

`RETRIEVE_K` and chunk size directly cap guide tokens on hit. See cost ceiling
notes in `CLAUDE.md` (preferred-guide RAG section).
