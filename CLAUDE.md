# GameGuide Go

## Purpose

Mobile-first, installable (PWA) Next.js prototype that answers a player's game
question. The model (Gemini 2.5 Flash on Replicate) answers from its own
knowledge; tiered web search provides supporting evidence. Supports
TheGamesDB-backed game-name autocomplete (with box art; IGDB is the eventual
upgrade), a fuzzy/acronym-aware platform selector, multi-turn
follow-up chat, an optional preferred-guide source, and optional Supabase
accounts that save per-game chats. The UI is English; the model still answers in
the player's input language. No login wall: signed-out users keep full access;
chats persist on-device in `localStorage` (cap 20) via `lib/local-games.js` but
do not sync to the cloud or use Storage uploads.

## Architecture

- `app/page.tsx`: English client chat UI (game field, platform, optional
 preferred-guide link, global major-spoiler toggle (profile menu + `user_metadata.spoiler_major`) and per-game major-spoiler toggle (setup **Spoilers** opt-tab + compact toggle on the game card; `loadGameSpoilerPrefs`/`saveGameSpoilerPrefs` in `lib/spoiler-prefs.js`; effective = global OR per-game), message feed,
 docked composer) and `/api/solve` consumer.
  Keeps `messages` state and sends the last 10 messages (5 turns) as `history`
  plus `preferredUrls` (up to 5) and `spoilerPrefs` (`major`, default off). Also owns Supabase auth state, the "Your games" menu
  (list/resume/new/delete), per-turn chat persistence (auto-creates a new saved
  chat when the game name changes mid-session), edit/retry on message bubbles,
  structured highlight sections on assistant replies, a game metadata card with
  box art (replaces the input fields once a chat starts; edit reopens the fields),
  cover art (signed-in only, to keep the anon flow simple and Storage-free):
  TheGamesDB box art plus optional device upload whose Storage write is DEFERRED to
  the first save (so abandoned drafts cost nothing), with a letter-tile placeholder
  fallback; autocomplete also auto-fills the platform selector via
  `tgdbPlatformToLabel`; a sticky mini-header (cover + game/platform + back-to-top),
  a collapsible left sidebar (burger toggle) that lists saved games (cover + game +
  platform·year) with a per-row kebab -> Edit/Delete menu and a Library button that
  opens a 2-column cover-art grid,   per-message image attachments (signed-in only: compressed client-side, one
  paperclip menu beside Send for photo library or camera, uploaded to the `covers` bucket at send time, sent
  to Gemini via Replicate's `images` field`; edit/retry drops truncated turns'
  Storage images), profile avatar menu (theme, spoilers, sign out) and `/profile`
  page for `user_metadata.display_name` (LLM uses it in prompts), theme via
  `gg:theme` / `user_metadata.theme`,
  light-markdown rendering of answers (`lib/markdown.js`: bold/lists/headings),
  a dismissable examples strip
  (remembered in `localStorage`), and auto-scroll (smooth on new turns, instant
  jump to the last user message when opening a saved game; scroll-to-bottom FAB hides cleanly when bottom is reached). Refresh restores the open thread via `?chat=<id>`
  (signed-in saved chats) or a `sessionStorage` draft (`lib/chat-session.js`;
  anon / not-yet-saved). `runTurn`/`persistChat` centralise ask +
  save; `conversationGame` tracks which game the visible thread belongs to.
  **Server-Side Persistence:** `POST /api/solve` uses Next.js 15 `after()` to detach LLM generation and save directly to Supabase via the user's Auth token, guaranteeing the AI finishes even if the user force-closes the app.
  **Background Polling:** if the UI drops the SSE stream on network sleep, it smoothly changes status to "Continuing process..." and polls Supabase to reattach to the background result.
  **Temporary chat** (`temporary` flag): entered from the composer "+" menu, or via
  a quick-access incognito button on the saved game card (`.game-card-incognito`)
  and the sticky mini-header (`.sticky-incognito`), both shown when
  `activeChatId && !temporary`. While on, the docked composer's border
  goes **dashed** (`.composer.temporary`) and a dim, borderless incognito glyph sits
  left of "+" (`.composer-temp-flag`, tap to turn off) — an always-visible signal,
  unlike a header badge that scrolls away.
  When on, `persistChat` returns early and the URL/`sessionStorage` sync effect
  writes nothing, so the thread is memory-only and a refresh/close wipes it (follow-ups
  still work from `messages` state). It is a non-destructive detour: turning it ON
  snapshots the open thread (`preTemporaryRef`) and starts a fresh thread (keeping
  game/platform/cover); turning it OFF restores that snapshot, so cancelling before
  chatting drops you back in the chat you left. Only discarding a temporary thread
  that already has content confirms ("Discard"); an empty one turns off silently.
  Uploaded message images are deleted from Storage each turn so nothing orphans.
  `newGame`/`openChat` reset the flag off.
  While a turn runs the Send button becomes a **Stop** button that aborts the
  `/api/solve` fetch (`abortRef`); the client also fires a direct call to
  `/api/solve/cancel` which explicitly aborts the Replicate prediction (saving tokens).
  This Replicate-native cancel replaces the old `request.signal` abort to allow the background `after()` save to complete uninterrupted when the user merely backgrounds the app. A promise-based
  confirm dialog (`askConfirm(message, confirmLabel?, danger=true)` →
  `confirmState`) guards every destructive action (delete chat from the
  sidebar/game-card/library kebabs, clear cover, and edit/retry when it would drop
  attached images). Pass `danger:false` for a positive CTA (brand-accent button
  instead of red), e.g. the "Use your Steam account" offer. A themed `snackbar` (`toast`)
  confirms a successful Steam link. The game-card and saved-library cards use the
  sidebar kebab pattern (`menuOpenId`/`toggleRowMenu`) for Edit/Delete; the
  sticky-header back arrow calls `goHome` (pops the pushed chat entry). Mobile
  **edge-swipe**: left→sidebar, right→last-opened library (`lastLibrary`; Steam
  when connected, else saved), signed-in only, disabled while an overlay/edit is
  active.
- `app/auth-panel.tsx`: themed sign-in/sign-up modal (email+password, Google
  OAuth via `getSupabase().auth`, and **Continue with Steam** →
  `/api/steam/login?intent=signin`). Surfaces the "check your email" state when the
  project has email confirmation enabled.
- `lib/supabase.ts`: `getSupabase()` singleton browser client from the
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` vars; returns `null` when unset so the app degrades to
  anonymous-only. Exports the `Chat` row type.
- `lib/local-games.js`: anon "recent games" list in `localStorage`
  (`gg:local-games`, `Chat`-shaped, cap 20) so signed-out users also get the
  home quick-access carousel, sidebar, and library. `loadChats`/`persistChat`/
  `saveGameMeta`/`deleteChat` in `page.tsx` branch on `userRef` (Supabase when
  signed-in, this when anon). Anon has no Storage, so these rows are text +
  metadata only (cover is a CDN URL or ""). **Home layout:** empty account →
  marketing hero + setup form (+ examples); has saved games → compact hero +
  **Jump back in** carousel (`.quick-home`, native scroll-snap, uniform cards,
  up to 4 + a "+N more" tile that opens the saved library) + **"+ New game"** /
  **Saved library** / **Steam library** (when connected) buttons. "+ New game"
  collapses the hero (`.hero-shell--exit`) and reveals the setup form below the
  carousel with a push-up entrance (`.setup--from-quick`). Sidebar + library are
  ungated for anon (Steam/profile controls stay `user`-only).
- `app/platform-select.tsx`: custom themed, searchable, keyboard-accessible
  platform combobox. Delegates filtering to `lib/platforms.js`.
- `lib/platforms.js`: owns the `PLATFORMS` list and `matchPlatforms(query)`, a
  normalized-substring + acronym/alias matcher (n64, nds, psx, ps1, ps2, gba,
  xsx, ...), plus `tgdbPlatformToLabel(name)` which maps a TheGamesDB platform
  name to one of our labels (numbered consoles before the bare family; "" when
  unsure, so autocomplete never auto-fills the wrong platform). `npm run check`.
- `app/game-autocomplete.tsx`: debounced game-name autocomplete for the game
  field; queries `/api/games`, reuses the `.combo` styling, shows a box-art thumb
  per row, and groups results by platform label (`groupByPlatform` via
  `tgdbPlatformToLabel`) so a multi-console game lists one row per console under a
  header — headers only when >1 group. `prepareAutocompleteGames` (in
  `lib/games.js`) collapses identical TGDB rows under the same name · platform ·
  year and shows a release-date hint when real variants remain. Allows free text and hides itself when the
  DB is unavailable (`available: false`). `onPick` surfaces the chosen
  `{ name, year, cover, platform }` to the page (manual typing clears the stale
  cover); `showCover` is off for signed-out users.
- `app/guide-link-field.tsx`: preferred-guide twin tabs — **Paste link** (add up to
  5 URLs) or **Search web** (queries `/api/guide-search` with game/platform +
  optional keywords; **Add** appends a hit to the list). Auto-runs a search when
  the tab opens if a game name is set. `lib/guide-urls.js` owns URL validation,
  dedupe, chat/draft coercion, and legacy `preferredUrl` / `preferred_guide_url`
  fallback.
- `app/api/guide-search/route.ts`: browse endpoint for the picker. Calls
  `discoverGuideLinks` (tiered Tavily/Serper, no answer-time confidence gate).
  Returns `{ results: [{ title, url, snippet }], available }`; `available: false`
  when neither `TAVILY_API_KEY` nor `SERPER_API_KEY` is set.
- `lib/steam.js`: Steam OpenID login URL + verification, owned-games fetch
  (`IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames`), Steam CDN library cover URLs,
  `fetchSteamReleaseYear` (keyless Store `appdetails` — no `filters=basic`, which
  omits `release_date`; owned-games has no release date. Keyless on purpose so the
  year works even when `STEAM_API_KEY` is unset; IP rate-limited ~200/5min), and
  `steamIdFromMetadata` (reads the linked `steam_id` from Supabase `user_metadata`).
  Steam is **both a sign-in method and a link action**. Steam OpenID returns
  ONLY a numeric SteamID (no email), so a Steam login can never merge-by-email
  with a Google/email account — Steam-login accounts live in a reserved email
  namespace (`steam_<id>@steam.gameguidego.local`, see `lib/steam-account.js`).
  **Sign in with Steam** ("Continue with Steam" in the logged-out auth modal):
  after OpenID verifies the SteamID, `POST /api/steam/session` (service-role)
  resolves **one SteamID → one home account**: if a Google/email account already
  linked this Steam (`findLinkedAccount` scans users for `steam_id` with
  `login_via !== "steam"`), it signs into THAT account via `admin.generateLink`
  (magiclink) + server-side `verifyOtp`; otherwise it admin-creates/reuses a
  synthetic account keyed by the SteamID (deterministic HMAC password,
  `email_confirm:true`) and `signInWithPassword`. Either way it returns the
  session tokens for the client to adopt (`loginWithSteam` → `setSession` +
  `refreshSession`). The Steam persona `display_name`/`avatar_steam` come from
  `fetchSteamProfile` and `avatar_steam` is refreshed on every login. The library
  then loads from the account's `steam_id`. **Link** ("Connect Steam" in the
  sidebar, signed-in only) attaches Steam to an existing Google/email account,
  unchanged. `/api/steam/link` refuses (409 `steam_is_login_account`) to attach a
  SteamID that already backs a *synthetic* Steam-login account (no auto-merge; the
  user picks one entry point). On that 409 the client doesn't dead-end:
  `linkSteamToAccount` returns `is_login_account`, and the `?steam=linked` handler
  offers a "Use your Steam account" confirm that runs `loginWithSteam` to switch
  into the existing Steam account. Intent is round-tripped through
  the OpenID `return_to` (`i=signin|link`), so the callback redirects
  `?steam=signin` vs `?steam=linked` with no extra cookie. Requires
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `STEAM_API_KEY`; without the service key the
  bridge 501s and Steam degrades to link-only. `lib/steam-session.js` signs
  a device-scoped `gg_steam` HMAC cookie (30-day, keyed by `AUTH_SECRET` or
  `STEAM_API_KEY`) holding the verified numeric SteamID — Steam OpenID never
  returns an email, so accounts never merge by email.
  Flow: `app/api/steam/login` -> Steam OpenID -> `callback` verifies and sets the
  `gg_steam` cookie, then redirects `/?steam=linked`. The client links **only**
  on that explicit return (`linkSteamToAccount` writes `steam_id` via
  `POST /api/steam/link` with bearer + `refresh_token` so the route can
  `setSession` before `updateUser` — see `docs/troubleshooting.md` if link
  fails with `Auth session missing!`); the sign-in effect merely *refreshes* status and never
  auto-links, so a leftover device cookie can't silently attach to the next user.
  `signOut` clears `gg_steam` (`DELETE /api/steam/pending`). `GET /api/steam/me`
  and `GET /api/steam/library` (Bearer token) trust **only** the account's linked
  Steam when authenticated — the cookie is used solely in the token-less transient
  right after the OpenID return — so a shared browser can't leak one user's
  library to another. `app/steam-library.tsx` grid UI (with search filter, a
  **sort control** — icon button beside the search bar; options Recently played /
  Most played / Name / Release year, each toggling asc/desc (↑/↓ on the active
  option, menu reveal animated), default Recently played (desc) since Steam
  exposes no "date added"; persisted as `"<key>:<dir>"` in
  `user_metadata.steam_sort` + `localStorage` `gg:steam-sort` so it syncs across
  devices — and square in-theme loading
  skeletons); each card shows **platform · release year** (not playtime).
  The active **game card** (cover + title + platform · year) also shows optional
  HowLongToBeat playtime (`27h main story`) for any game title via
  `app/hltb-row.tsx` + `GET /api/hltb?title=` (optional `appId` when the cover
  is a Steam CDN URL). The sticky header shows the same main-story figure inline
  after platform · year (flex-wrap when space is tight). Server read-through cache in
  `public.hltb_cache` keyed by normalized title (30d TTL — see `db/hltb-cache.sql`).
  Existing pre-year Steam chats are backfilled once per mount by an effect in
  `page.tsx` that reads the appId from the chat's Steam cover URL
  (`steamAppIdFromCoverUrl`) and fills the empty `release_year`. The `/api/steam/library` route enriches owned-games with release
  years via `fetchSteamReleaseYears` (batch `IStoreBrowseService/GetItems`, one
  call per 50-id chunk) so the year is on the `SteamGame` when picked — no per-game
  fetch. Picking a game opens/resumes a PC chat with Steam cover art (year set
  immediately from the shelf; `/api/steam/release-year` is only a fallback for
  games GetItems omits). It caches the fetched list in `localStorage` (`gg:steam-library`,
  keyed per account via the `cacheKey` prop, 6h TTL) and renders it instantly on
  reopen while revalidating in the background (stale-while-revalidate) — no more
  full reload every open. Requires `STEAM_API_KEY`; user's Steam **Game details**
  must be Public.
- `lib/hltb.js` + `lib/hltb-cache.js` + `app/api/hltb/route.ts` + `app/hltb-row.tsx`:
  HowLongToBeat playtime on the game card (any platform). HLTB has no public API;
  the server fetches a per-visit token from HLTB's rotating internal search
  endpoint (`SEARCH_SEG` in `lib/hltb-cache.js`), searches by normalized title
  tokens, and matches via `pickBestMatch` (optional Steam appId → exact name →
  fuzzy). Results are cached in `public.hltb_cache` (`cache_key` = normalized
  title, nullable `data` jsonb, 30d TTL). No login required. Fail-open when
  Supabase is unset (direct upstream search).
- `app/api/games/route.ts`: TheGamesDB proxy. Runs
  `Games/ByGameName?include=boxart,platform` with `THEGAMESDB_API_KEY` and returns
  `{ games, available }` (each game has `cover` + raw `platform` name). Missing key
  or any failure => `available: false` so the field degrades to free text.
  `lib/games.js#mapGames` shapes the payload. Provider swap to IGDB later is this
  file + `mapGames` only.
- `app/api/solve/route.ts`: validates/sanitizes `{ game, platform, question,
  history, preferredUrls, spoilerPrefs, playerName }` at the trust boundary (history capped to 10, content
  truncated, `preferredUrls` capped/deduped via `lib/guide-urls.js`, `spoilerPrefs` coerced to booleans,
  `playerName` from `display_name`, max 32 chars). Always calls `resolveQuestion`
  to rewrite the query into standalone English. When any preferred URL is set, runs
  preferred-guide RAG (`lib/guide-rag.ts`: lazy ingest all URLs, embed query,
  pgvector retrieve across `guide_url = any($urls)`, similarity-route at
  `GUIDE_HIT`); on a high-similarity hit the retrieved chunks are marked
  `preferred` and tiered web search is skipped. On a low-similarity miss (or when
  RAG infra is unset) falls back to tiered Tavily/Serper search. Without preferred
  URLs, tiered search only (cached in `lib/search-cache.ts` keyed by `searchQuery`).
  Search is best-effort (skipped if no search API key, failures swallowed); the model
  still answers. Returns `{ answer, highlights, sources, spoilers, guideHint? }`
  (`spoilers` trimmed to `[]` when `spoilerPrefs.major` is false). Only
  `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is mandatory.
- `app/api/guide-bundle/route.ts`: `GET ?url=` previews GameFAQs multi-page FAQ
  bundles (page count + section list) before the user confirms add. Discovery
  uses `lib/gamefaqs-discover.ts` (site search + extract TOC enrichment; GameFAQs
  blocks direct HTML fetch). `GET /api/guide-bundle/status?url=` returns bundle
  title + discovery page list from `guide_bundle_cache` and per-page indexed rows
  from `guide_chunks` (Supabase only, no Tavily). Used for the game-card
  (`app/bundle-index-panel.tsx`: missing pages listed first with Skip/Include
  controls and optional Retry; toast names failed sections via `pagesMissing`.
  Page pick at add time in `app/guide-link-field.tsx`; skip/select prefs in
  `lib/bundle-prefs.js` (`localStorage` `gg:bundle-prefs`; signed-in users sync
  `user_metadata.bundle_prefs` across devices, skip union + selected remote-wins).
  Discovery merges Tavily search (base + per-part when sparse), extract TOC,
  `public.guide_bundle_cache` (30d TTL, `db/guide-bundle-cache.sql`), and pages
  already in `guide_chunks` so partial runs accumulate over time. Game-card loading:
  inline spinner on the guide link (not a skeleton); collapsible index panel after
  meta + status fetches complete. See **GameFAQs multi-page bundles** below.
- `app/api/guide-ingest/route.ts`: lazy shared ingest for one or more preferred
  guide URLs (GameFAQs bundles expand to discovered TOC pages, filtered by
  `bundlePrefs` skip/include). Accepts `game`/`platform`/`userId` for embed audit
  logs. Skips re-ingest client-side when all target pages are indexed. Returns
  `pagesMissing` when bundle sections fail extract/embed. Orphan pre-bundle root
  rows are deleted on ingest.
- `app/api/guide-ingest/status/route.ts`: lightweight read-only endpoint checking
  the indexing status (indexed: true/false) of any preferred guide URL without triggering ingest.
- `lib/gamefaqs-bundle.js`: GameFAQs FAQ autodetect, TOC discovery, bundle
  canonical URL normalization (max 50 pages per bundle). Chunks store optional
  `guide_bundle` (`db/guide-bundle.sql`) for retrieval across all pages.
- `lib/guide-rag.ts` + `lib/guide-ingest.ts` + `lib/chunk-guide.js` +
  `lib/embed.ts` + `lib/embed-cache.ts`: preferred-guide RAG. Tavily extract the
  pasted page (`extractGuidePage`), structure-aware chunking (`chunkGuide`),
  text-embedding-3-large on Sumopod (OpenAI-compatible) (`EMBED_MODEL`, default
  `text-embedding-3-large`), shared `public.guide_chunks` + `match_guide_chunks`
  RPC (pgvector, 1024-dim). Query embeddings cached in `public.embed_cache` (7-day
  TTL). Fail-open to tiered web search when Supabase/pgvector/Sumopod API key is unset.
  Also supports **file uploads** (PDF/TXT/MD) via `POST /api/guide-upload` —
  files are parsed in memory (zero storage), chunked, and embedded into the same
  `guide_chunks` table with a synthetic `upload://<uid>/<filename>` key.
  `lib/parse-guide-file.ts` handles PDF extraction (pdf-parse) and plain text.
  Full design: [`docs/preferred-guide.md`](docs/preferred-guide.md).
  Embedding model specs & migration checklist: [`docs/embedding-models.md`](docs/embedding-models.md).
- `lib/tavily.ts`: `searchGuides(query)` orchestrates Tavily tiered search then a
  Serper.dev fallback; `extractGuidePage(url)` pulls full page text for RAG ingest
  (**Tavily Extract only** — Serper cannot replace this); `discoverGuideLinks(...)`
  powers the guide picker (Tavily then Serper fallback). See provider fallback
  notes under Known limits.
- `lib/search-cache.ts`: best-effort Supabase-backed cache of `searchGuides`
  output (`getCachedSearch`/`setCachedSearch`, 7-day TTL). Uses the shared
  `getServerClient()` from `lib/supabase-server.ts`; no-ops when unset or
  on any error so answers never depend on it.
- `lib/rank.js`: `selectSources(results)` applies a confidence gate (returns
  `[]` when even the best score is below `CONFIDENCE_MIN`, so the model answers
  from knowledge alone), keeps results within `SCORE_WINDOW` of the top score,
  and caps at 3. Covered by `npm run check`.
- `lib/clean.js`: `cleanSnippet(text)` strips markdown link soup, bare URLs,
  GameFAQs CTAs, and Q&A vote/user lines. `focusSection(text, query, cap)` trims
  a long extracted page to the `cap`-sized window with the most query-term hits,
  so a huge single-page guide is cut to the relevant section. Both covered by
  `npm run check`.
- `lib/replicate.ts`: Replicate adapter. `summarize(input)` sends
  `system_instruction` + `prompt` separately with Gemini fields
  (`max_output_tokens`, `thinking_budget: 0`), polls prediction status to yield granular `status` events (e.g. "Starting AI engine") to the UI during generation, and parses the JSON
  `{ answer, highlights, spoilers, spoilerRisk }` via `lib/highlights.js#parseSummary`.
  All three Gemini calls (`resolveQuestion`, `summarize`, `censorSpoilers`) share
  a single `Replicate` SDK instance (`getReplicate()` singleton).
  `/api/solve` calls `censorSpoilers` when spoilers are OFF and `spoilerRisk` is
  true (best-effort rewrite; fails open). `resolveQuestion({ question, history, forRag? })`
  does a small Gemini call: short web-search query (≤15 words) by default, or a
  longer contextual retrieval query (~60 words) when `forRag` is set for preferred-guide
  RAG embed. Falls back to the raw question on any failure. Exports the
  `Turn`, `Highlight`, `SpoilerReveal`, and `SummaryResult` types.
- `lib/profile.js`: `display_name` / avatar helpers for the profile menu and page.
  `avatarUrlFromUser` is pref-aware: it honours `user_metadata.avatar_pref`
  (`google`/`steam`/`upload`) when that source exists, else falls back
  upload > google > steam (so unifying a Steam login into a Google account keeps
  the Google photo). `avatarSourcesFromUser` exposes the per-source URLs
  (`picture`/`avatar_url`, `avatar_steam`, `avatar_upload`) for the `/profile`
  photo picker. The picker uploads to the `covers` bucket (`<uid>/avatar-*.jpg`)
  and writes `avatar_upload` + `avatar_pref`.
- `lib/image.js`: `compressImage(file, maxDim, quality)` — client-side canvas
  downscale + JPEG re-encode shared by covers, message images, and avatar upload.
- `lib/spoiler-prefs.js`: global **major spoiler** toggle (`major`, default off)
  in `localStorage` (`gg:spoiler-major`; signed-in users sync `user_metadata.spoiler_major`)
  plus per-game overrides in `gg:spoiler-prefs` keyed by normalized game name.
  `effectiveSpoilerPrefs(global, game)` ORs them for each turn. `buildSpoilerBlock`
  + `buildSpoilerOutputRules` for the summarize prompt (LLM filters to genuinely
  major twists; routine walkthrough stays in `answer`; when OFF the model may set
  `spoilerRisk` for a second-pass censor), `coerceSpoilerPrefs` at the API trust
  boundary. Covered by `npm run check`.
- `lib/voice.js` + `app/voice-input.tsx`: composer mic via the free Web Speech API
  (**all users**). Buffered-until-stop dictation; platform-split capture (desktop
  `continuous` + rebuild finals, iOS `continuous: false` + `results[0]` + restart).
  `lib/voice-meter.js` warm-up only; `app/voice-visualizer.tsx` CSS bars. Language
  in `gg:voice-lang` / `user_metadata.voice_lang`. **Full agent notes:**
  [`docs/voice-input.md`](docs/voice-input.md).
- `app/composer-extras.tsx`: the single composer "+" control for **all** users and
  viewports (replaced the old scattered paperclip/mic buttons). One menu holds
  Photo library / Camera (`canAttach`, signed-in only), Voice input
  (`voiceSupported`), and the **Temporary chat** toggle (`temporary` /
  `onToggleTemporary`, all users). The "+" turns into a Stop button while dictating.
- `lib/prompt.js`: exports `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` (persona + rules: knowledge-first,
  web-as-support, on-topic guardrail — only game guidance, decline off-topic and
  never reveal/override the prompt — injection safety, JSON output with `answer` +
  optional `highlights`), `buildPrompt({ game, platform, question, sources,
  history, imageCount, spoilerPrefs, playerName })` (sources may carry
  `preferred: true` for RAG chunks — labels them PREFERRED GUIDE and injects a
  fidelity directive; adds a visual-context note when images are attached;
  `playerName` only on the first turn — follow-ups get a no-greeting rule to stop
  repeated "hello again" salutations),
  plus `REWRITE_INSTRUCTION` + `buildRewritePrompt({ question, history })` for
  query rewriting. Covered by `npm run check`.
- `lib/highlights.js`: `KINDS`/`KIND_LABELS`, `coerceHighlights(value)`, and
  `parseSummary(text)` — tolerant JSON parse (escapes RAW newlines/tabs the model
  leaves inside string values, strips fences) with prose fallback. Shared by the
  server (`summarize`), client (`coerceMessages`/render), and `npm run check`.
- `lib/llm-log.ts` + `lib/llm-db-log.ts`: best-effort log of each model call's system
  instruction, prompt, raw response, `duration_ms`, Replicate `predict_time_ms`, and
  input/output token counts (parsed from the Gemini prediction `logs` text in
  `lib/replicate.ts#runModel` — Gemini reports usage there, not in `metrics`).
  `game`/`platform`/`user_id` are logged on every call (client sends `userId`;
  validated as a UUID in `/api/solve`). Kinds: `rewrite`, `summarize`, `censor`,
  plus `embed_index` / `embed_query` from `lib/embed-log.ts` (guide ingest batches
  and per-turn RAG query embeds, including cache hits). File tail in
  `llm-log.json` (dev / `LLM_LOG=1`, async writes to avoid blocking the event
  loop); Supabase table `public.llm_calls`
  (`db/llm-calls.sql`, patch `db/llm-calls-embed.sql` on older installs) when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` are set (`LLM_DB_LOG=0` disables). Insert-only RLS — no client reads.
- `lib/supabase-server.ts`: shared server-side Supabase client
  (`getServerClient()`, anon key, no session). All server modules — caches
  (`search-cache`, `embed-cache`, `hltb-cache`, `guide-bundle-cache`), logs
  (`llm-db-log`, `solve-log`), RAG (`guide-rag`), and ingest (`guide-ingest`) —
  import from this single module instead of each maintaining a private singleton.
  Separate from `lib/supabase.ts` (`getSupabase`) which is the browser client
  used by `page.tsx` (with auth session).
- `lib/hero-copy.js`: rotating home marketing copy — `FUN_ROLES` (eyebrow
  "Companion for …", cycles on a timer; tap pauses/resumes) and `HERO_LINES`
  (`[hook, payoff]` headline pairs; one picked at random per open; index 0 is the
  SSR-stable default).
- `app/profile-menu.tsx`: signed-in nav avatar dropdown — link to `/profile`,
  global spoiler toggle, theme picker (System/Light/Dark via `lib/theme.js`),
  sign out. Theme/spoiler writes sync to `user_metadata` when signed in.
- `lib/games.js`: `mapGames(payload)` maps a TheGamesDB `ByGameName?include=boxart`
  payload to `{ id, name, year, releaseDate, cover, platform }` (year from
  `release_date`, cover from the front box-art in the `include` block), dropping
  malformed entries. `prepareAutocompleteGames` dedupes noisy same-console
  duplicates and attaches a release-date hint when rows still differ.
  Covered by `npm run check`.
- PWA + brand: UI font is **Rubik** via `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`. **Theme
  rules** (no rounded corners, tokens, layout): [`docs/ui-theme.md`](docs/ui-theme.md).
  The logo is `GGG.png` (2000x2000 source, `#00FFAA` bg), resized with `sips` into
  static icons — `app/icon.png` (favicon), `app/apple-icon.png` (apple-touch),
  `public/icon-192.png` / `public/icon-512.png` (manifest `purpose: "any"`), and
  `public/logo.png` (nav brand mark, `<img>` in `app/page.tsx`). Maskable is a
  **separate** padded icon `public/icon-512-maskable.png` (`sips -Z 380` then
  `--padToHeightWidth 512 512 --padColor 00FFAA`) so Android's adaptive mask
  doesn't zoom/crop the tight-framed logo — never point `purpose: "maskable"` at
  the plain icon. Manifest `background_color`/`theme_color` are `#00FFAA` (Android
  splash). iOS ignores those, so `public/splash/apple-splash-<w>-<h>.png` (solid
  `#00FFAA` + centered logo, `sips` pad) are wired as `apple-touch-startup-image`
  `<link>` tags generated from `APPLE_SPLASH` in `app/layout.tsx` (curated
  portrait device set). Re-run the `sips` commands to regenerate from a new source.
  `public/sw.js` is a network-first service worker (cache `gg-runtime-v2`, evicts
  stale caches on activate) registered by `app/sw-register.tsx`. The `viewport`
  export in `app/layout.tsx` sets `maximumScale: 1` + `userScalable: false` to
  disable pinch-zoom (honored in the installed PWA; iOS Safari tabs ignore it by
  design).
- Persistence model: one `public.chats` row per saved game (`game`, `platform`,
  `preferred_guide_url` (legacy first URL), `preferred_guide_urls` (text[]; see
  `db/preferred-guide-urls.sql`), `cover_url`, `release_year`, `messages` jsonb), RLS-scoped
  to `auth.uid()`; the client upserts the whole `messages` array each turn and
  reads with `select("*")` so it tolerates the cover columns being absent before
  the migration. Device-uploaded covers live in the public `covers` Storage bucket
  under an `<uid>/` prefix (RLS: owner writes, public read). Both are set up by
  `db/cover-metadata.sql`. `public.search_cache` is a shared public cache table
  (see Known limits).

## GameFAQs multi-page bundles (agent reference)

Full design doc: [`docs/preferred-guide.md`](docs/preferred-guide.md). This section
is the behaviour contract agents must not skip.

### When it applies

- Any preferred-guide URL matching `/faqs/{id}/` on `gamefaqs.gamespot.com` is a
  **bundle** (`isGamefaqsBundleUrl` in `lib/guide-urls.js`). One URL in the user's
  list expands to many indexed pages under `guide_bundle = gamefaqs:{faqId}`.

### Discovery (page list — not indexing yet)

GameFAQs blocks direct HTML fetch (Cloudflare 403). `lib/gamefaqs-discover.ts`
(`discoverGamefaqsBundleResolved`) is the single entry point for preview + ingest.

**Two modes** (`DiscoverOptions.refresh`):

| Mode | When | Tavily? |
|------|------|---------|
| **Cache-first** (default) | `GET /api/guide-bundle` (add-time preview only) | No — reads `guide_bundle_cache` + `guide_chunks` |
| **Full refresh** (`?refresh=1`) | Add-bundle preview, **Refresh page list** button | Yes — full pipeline below |

Full refresh pipeline:

1. **Direct fetch** (`discoverGamefaqsBundle` in `lib/gamefaqs-bundle.js`) when
   Cloudflare allows (rare).
2. **Tavily Extract** introduction / walkthrough / root → `parseGamefaqsTocFromHtml`.
3. **Tavily Site Search** (`searchDiscoveryUrls`, up to 30 hits/query):
   - Base queries (`buildGamefaqsDiscoveryBaseQueries`): path-wide, part-, walkthrough,
     boss, faq, game name.
   - If merged pages **< 12** (`PART_QUERY_PAGE_THRESHOLD`), per-part queries
     (`buildGamefaqsPartDiscoveryQueries`): `part-1`…`part-25`,
     `walkthrough-part-1`…`15`, plus common slugs (faq, boss-guides, etc.).
4. **TOC enrichment**: extract up to 6 seed pages (intro, walkthrough, part-1, faq)
   and merge any extra TOC links found in extracted text.
5. **Merge sources (union, never shrink)**:
   - Fresh discovery
   - `public.guide_bundle_cache` (`lib/guide-bundle-cache.js`, 30d TTL,
     `db/guide-bundle-cache.sql`) keyed by `bundle_key`
   - Pages already in `guide_chunks` for that bundle (`getIndexedBundlePagesFromDb`)
6. Upsert merged list back to `guide_bundle_cache`.

**Indexing** uses cache-first discovery first; runs full refresh only when a target
`includeSlug` has no URL in the cached list.

**Important:** Tavily Search is **not** a full site crawler. A guide may have 20+
real pages while discovery finds 12–18. Pages **never discovered** have no URL to
index; pages **discovered but extract failed** can retry. Discovery can **grow**
across runs via cache union; it does not guess missing slugs.

`MAX_BUNDLE_PAGES = 50` in `lib/gamefaqs-bundle.js` is the app cap, not the cause
of ~16-page discovery gaps.

### Add-bundle UX (`app/guide-link-field.tsx`)

- Paste bundle URL → `GET /api/guide-bundle?refresh=1` preview → checkbox list of discovered
  pages (Select all / Clear) → **Add bundle (N pages)**.
- `selectedSlugs` saved to `lib/bundle-prefs.js` + `guideBundleMeta` on the client.
  Panel and ingest only track those slugs when set (`filterBundlePanelPages`).

### Bundle prefs (`lib/bundle-prefs.js`)

Per canonical bundle URL (`gg:bundle-prefs` in `localStorage`; signed-in users also
`user_metadata.bundle_prefs`):

- `selectedSlugs`: pages user chose at add time (ingest `includeSlugs`).
- `skippedSlugs`: user Skip on game card (ingest `skipSlugs`); union across devices
  on login; `selectedSlugs` remote-wins when both devices set a selection.
- `clearBundlePrefs()`: wipes `gg:bundle-prefs` and resets the sync state; called
  on sign-out to prevent cross-account pref bleed on shared devices.

Sent to server as `bundlePrefs` on `POST /api/guide-ingest` and `POST /api/solve`.
`buildBundlePrefsBody` in `page.tsx` prefers UI state (`guideBundleMeta`) over
`localStorage` so the server always gets the selection the user sees on-screen,
even when `localStorage` writes fail (private browsing, quota). After ingest
completes, the `finally` block does a final `/api/guide-bundle/status` read to
verify actual indexed state before clearing the progress indicator.

### Indexing (`lib/guide-ingest.ts`, `POST /api/guide-ingest`)

- Runs before first solve turn per guide URL (and from `lib/guide-rag.ts` on solve).
- **Pre-database check**: queries `guide_chunks` for existing URLs *before* invoking Tavily extract, drastically saving credits and latency on repeat ingest attempts.
- **Resume**: per-page idempotent — failed/missing pages retried on next turn.
- **Skip ingest when done**: client skips `POST /api/guide-ingest` when
  `bundleHasPendingPages` is false (all target slugs indexed or skipped) or when local `guideIndexState` confirms a single-page guide is already indexed. Server `isGuideIndexed` includes a canonical URL fallback to gracefully handle GameFAQs single-page URLs submitted with arbitrary query parameters (e.g. `?page=1`).
- Filters discovery by `skipSlugs` / `includeSlugs` from `bundlePrefs`.
- Deletes orphan pre-bundle root chunks on bundle ingest.
- Returns `pagesMissing` (failed, not skipped), `pagesIndexed`, `pageCount` (target
  after filters). Toast via `guideIngestHintFromResponse` names missing page titles.
- Sequential per-URL ingest; Tavily extract batches (`INGEST_EXTRACT_BATCH_SIZE`,
  default 5) with delay. `maxDuration = 300` on the route.
- Embed audit: `embed_index` rows in `llm_calls` (`lib/embed-log.ts`).

### Game card UI (`app/page.tsx`, `app/bundle-index-panel.tsx`)

Guide links and bundle panels are paired in `.game-card-guide-stack` (full card
width, one stack per preferred URL). Spoiler toggle is in `.game-card-spoiler`
below all guides (game-level, not per guide). See [`docs/ui-theme.md`](docs/ui-theme.md).

One Supabase-only fetch per bundle URL on load / `bundleStatusRev` bump:

| Fetch | Endpoint | Backend | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Panel state | `/api/guide-bundle/status` | `getBundleIndexStatus` → `guide_bundle_cache` + `guide_chunks` | Title, page list, indexed rows |
| Add preview | `/api/guide-bundle?refresh=1` | full Tavily discovery | Before user confirms add |
| Refresh list | `/api/guide-bundle?refresh=1` | full Tavily discovery | User-triggered; costs credits |

`bundlePanelLoad` tracks `{ meta, status }` per URL. While loading:

- **Inline spinner** (`.game-card-bundle-spinner`) beside `IconArrowUpRight` on the
  guide link — **no vertical skeleton** (saves space).
- Collapsible `BundleIndexPanel` hidden until the status fetch completes.

Panel when loaded:

- Summary: `Indexed X of Y (your selection)` when `selectedSlugs` set; missing/skipped counts.
- Missing rows first, **Skip** / **Include**, **Retry missing pages**, **Ignore remaining pages**
  (bulk skip), **Refresh page list** (full Tavily discovery).
- `missingPages` excludes `skippedSlugs` and slugs outside `selectedSlugs`; merges ingest
  `pagesMissing` + discovery minus indexed.

### RAG per turn (`lib/guide-rag.ts`)

- `retrieveFromPreferredGuides` ingests (with `bundlePrefs`), embeds query
  (`embed_query` in `llm_calls`), `match_guide_chunks` with `GUIDE_HIT` threshold.
- High hit → `skipWebSearch: true`; else tiered Tavily + one chunk fallback.
- **DO NOT add an ANN index (ivfflat/hnsw) on `guide_chunks.embedding`.**
  Retrieval always filters by `guide_url`/`guide_bundle` first (btree), then does an
  EXACT cosine sort on that ≤~dozens-of-rows subset — fast + 100% recall. A prior
  ivfflat index (`lists=100`, default `probes=1`) made the planner use it for the
  ORDER BY and return only ~1 (approximate, often WRONG) chunk per query on the tiny
  per-guide set — which surfaced as a preferred-guide answer drifting off the guide
  even though `hit=true`. Removed in `db/guide-chunks.sql`; re-add hnsw only for
  unfiltered global KNN over 100k+ chunks.

### Skipped Refactors (Tier 3)

The following Tier 3 cleanup tasks were deliberately skipped to prioritize stability:

- **Dead-page pruning (`lib/gamefaqs-discover.ts`)**: Currently uses union-only merge
  for discovery caches (`mergeGamefaqsBundlePages`). This means 404'd pages are never
  dropped. We skipped implementing a hard prune or overwrite mode to avoid the risk of
  losing valid pages (and triggering excessive Tavily fallback searches) if an extraction
  transiently fails.
- **Deleting `guideBundleMeta` derived cache (`app/page.tsx`)**: The `guideBundleMeta`
  React state duplicates data from `bundleIndexStatus` (server) and `getBundlePrefs`
  (localStorage), causing multiple drift classes. We skipped the "mini-rewrite" to
  remove it because it touches almost all panel render logic and is highly error-prone.
  If drift becomes a critical issue, future agents should remove `guideBundleMeta` entirely
  and compute its properties on the fly (e.g. `missingPages = discovery \setminus indexed`).
- Debug retrieval with `RAG_DEBUG=1` → logs `[rag-calibrate] hit=… top=… scores=[…]
  top_chunk=…` per query (scores should have several entries, not one; top_chunk
  should match the question). This is the fastest way to tell a retrieval miss
  (wrong/too-few chunks) from a generation miss (right chunk, model ignored it).


### Self-heal cheat sheet

| Case | Auto-fix? |
|------|-----------|
| Discovered, extract failed | Retry next turn / Retry button |
| Indexed in DB, dropped from new discovery | Merged back from `guide_chunks` + cache |
| New discovery finds more pages later | Cache union adds them |
| Never discovered (no URL) | No — needs better discovery or user Skip |
| User Skip | Stops retry; excluded from missing toast |

### DB tables (apply SQL in `db/`)

- `guide_chunks` + `guide_bundle` column (`db/guide-bundle.sql`)
- `guide_bundle_cache` — discovery TOC cache
- `embed_cache`, `search_cache`, `llm_calls` (incl. `embed_index`, `embed_query`)

## Known limits (ponytail)

- Stop/cancel threads the client `AbortController` → `/api/solve` `request.signal`
  → `AbortSignal.any([timeout, signal])` into the `replicate.run` calls
  (`lib/replicate.ts`) and every Tavily/Serper fetch (`lib/tavily.ts`), so `run()`'s
  built-in signal cancels the prediction. It relies on Vercel propagating the
  client disconnect to `request.signal` (nodejs runtime); if a disconnect isn't
  propagated the prediction may finish server-side (result discarded). Upgrade
  path for guaranteed cancel: `predictions.create` + tracked id + a `/cancel`
  endpoint (needs SSE to hand the id to the client mid-flight).
- iOS PWA splash images are a curated **portrait-only** device set
  (`APPLE_SPLASH` in `app/layout.tsx`); landscape/older devices fall back to the
  OS default. Edge-swipe uses fixed edge (24px) / threshold (60px) heuristics and
  is meant for the installed PWA (a browser tab's own back-gesture can fight the
  left edge).
- Model-call input fields are Gemini-specific; switching `REPLICATE_MODEL` to a
  non-Gemini model would silently drop `system_instruction`/`thinking_budget`.
- Chat history is sent as plain text inside the prompt and trimmed by turn count,
  not token count.
- Searches are cached in `public.search_cache` (7-day TTL) keyed by rewritten
  query + preferred URL, so repeat/popular queries skip Tavily. A preliminary
  cache (`rewrite::hash`) prevents running the `resolveQuestion` rewrite call
  on exact input cache hits.
  Without Supabase env vars the cache no-ops and every turn re-runs the tiered
  search (up to 4 sequential `advanced` Tavily calls, ~2x credits vs `basic`).
- `search_cache` has permissive RLS (public select/insert/update via the anon
  key) so the server can write without a service-role secret. It only holds
  non-sensitive public web results the model already treats as untrusted, and the
  TTL self-heals; the ceiling is cache pollution, not a data leak. Upgrade path:
  move writes behind the service-role key or a `security definer` RPC.
- HLTB playtime uses the same permissive `hltb_cache` pattern (30d TTL). No
  single-flight lease or outbound token bucket yet — concurrent first-time misses
  for the same app can duplicate upstream searches; upgrade path: `claim_hltb_lease`
  + rate bucket like steamAntiFomo. HLTB's search path segment can rotate; update
  `SEARCH_SEG` in `lib/hltb-cache.js` when init/search starts 404ing.
- Preferred-guide RAG (`GUIDE_HIT` in `lib/guide-rag.ts`) is a hand-tuned cosine
  threshold, not a learned router. Chunking is recursive boundary-split in
  `lib/chunk-guide.js`, not semantic. Ingest has no single-flight lease (unique
  index guards dup rows; concurrent first-time ingests of the same URL can
  duplicate upstream embed work). Query-embed cache is best-effort (`embed_cache`).
  Given page only; hub/multi-page guides rely on the user pasting the real page
  (surfaced via optional `guideHint` toast; ingest failures toast from
  `POST /api/guide-ingest` before solve, with solve as fallback).
- **Preferred-guide RAG cost ceiling (cannot blow up per turn):** retrieval uses
  `match_guide_chunks` with `LIMIT` (`RETRIEVE_K = 5` in `lib/guide-rag.ts`) —
  the full ingested guide never goes to Gemini, only up to five stored chunks.
  Each chunk is sized at ingest (~500 tokens, `TARGET_CHARS` in
  `lib/chunk-guide.js`). On a high-similarity hit, Gemini `summarize` gets those
  five chunks plus rewrite/history/question (~3k–5k input tokens for research,
  not 50k+). On a miss: one best chunk + tiered web search (3 snippets × 800
  chars). **To spend less (future tuning):** (1) lower `RETRIEVE_K` (5 → 3) in
  `lib/guide-rag.ts`; (2) add a per-source `content` cap in `buildPrompt` (e.g.
  1500 chars) as a safety net if ingest ever stores one giant chunk; (3) raise
  `GUIDE_HIT` so more turns fall back to shorter Tavily snippets instead of five
  RAG chunks; (4) shorten the RAG rewrite cap in `resolveQuestion` (`forRag`
  `maxChars` / `REWRITE_RAG_INSTRUCTION` word limit). Do not remove the SQL
  `LIMIT` or send unbounded `guide_chunks` rows to `summarize`.
- Every turn runs two sequential Gemini calls (`resolveQuestion` then
  `summarize`). Web rewrite `max_output_tokens` ~200; preferred-guide RAG rewrite
  ~400 (`forRag`). Too tight a cap returns empty even with thinking off.
- `solve_logs.pipeline_type` now correctly records `"rag"` when preferred-guide
  RAG succeeds (`skipWebSearch`). Error-path `totalLatencyMs` uses `startedAt`
  (was previously `Date.now() - Date.now()` ≡ 0).
- `summarize` asks for JSON (`answer` + `highlights`); `parseSummary` tolerates
  prose/markdown fences when the model drifts. ponytail: prompt-instructed JSON
  rather than `response_mime_type` (not exposed on Replicate's Gemini input).
- Flash on Replicate consumes ~1k tokens of reasoning overhead against
  `max_output_tokens` even with `thinking_budget: 0`, so `summarize` uses 4096
  to avoid truncated answers (1200 cut answers off after ~100 visible tokens).
- Relevance filtering can't separate same-series wrong-game guides (RE0 vs RE
  Code: Veronica score alike); the top-3 trim plus the "ignore off-game
  snippets" system rule mitigate it rather than fully solving it.
- The `CONFIDENCE_MIN`/`SCORE_WINDOW` thresholds in `lib/rank.js` are heuristics
  calibrated on a handful of real queries, not a learned cutoff; tune them there
  if answers cite too much or fall back to knowledge too often.
- Tavily still returns arbitrary page chunks (control lists, TOCs), not the
  section that answers the question; the model leans on its own knowledge.
- **Search/extract provider fallback (important):** not all Tavily uses share the
  same backup. **Answer-time search** (`searchGuides`, `discoverGuideLinks`):
  Tavily Search → Serper.dev fallback (snippet-only). **Preferred-guide ingest**
  (`extractGuidePage` in `lib/tavily.ts`): **Tavily Extract only** — Serper has no
  page-extract API, so a **new** guide URL cannot be indexed when `TAVILY_API_KEY`
  is missing or Extract is down/quota-blocked (already-indexed URLs in
  `guide_chunks` keep working). Upgrade path for ingest resilience: (1) direct
  fetch + `cleanSnippet`/`readability` fallback (fragile on JS sites); (2) a
  dedicated extract provider wired beside Tavily in `extractGuidePage`. **Brave
  Search API (not wired):** standard `/web/search` is another snippet search —
  could back up Serper/Tavily Search, not Extract. Brave **LLM Context**
  (`/llm/context`) is query→ranked web chunks for grounding/RAG-style answers,
  not “extract this pasted URL in full” for one-time `guide_chunks` ingest; wrong
  shape unless we redesign ingest around search+`site:` (would miss off-page
  structure and still wouldn't mirror full-book chunking). Evaluate Brave for
  answer-time search before ingest.
- Game autocomplete + box art use TheGamesDB (single API key, web-friendly, but
  coverage/quality is patchier than IGDB and it has a monthly quota). IGDB has the
  best coverage and is the intended upgrade, gated only on Twitch app credentials;
  the provider swap is `app/api/games/route.ts` + `lib/games.js#mapGames`.
- Cover art is signed-in only (anon users get the plain fields, no Storage use).
  TheGamesDB covers are hotlinked from its CDN (zero Storage). Device uploads are
  held as a local `blob:` preview and written to the public `covers` bucket only at
  save time (`resolveCoverUrl` in the persist path), so abandoned picks never land
  in Storage. Bucket policy: owner-write under `<uid>/`, public read. Storage is
  cleaned to respect the free tier: deleting a chat removes its cover + all its
  message images, clearing a cover deletes its file, and replacing a cover deletes
  the one it replaced (`coverStoragePath` maps a public URL back to a bucket path;
  TheGamesDB CDN covers are skipped). Message images upload to `<uid>/msg/` at send.
- Autocomplete platform auto-fill depends on TheGamesDB returning
  `include=platform` and `tgdbPlatformToLabel` recognising the name; unknown names
  leave the selector untouched for manual choice.
- **Steam link + Supabase server auth:** `auth.updateUser()` on a server route
  fails with `Auth session missing!` if the Supabase client only has a bearer
  token in `global.headers` — `getUser()` still works, which is misleading.
  `POST /api/steam/link` must receive `refresh_token` and call `setSession`
  before `updateUser`. See [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md)
  (Connect Steam section) before changing that flow.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run build
```

## Environment

Server-only secrets (never expose via `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, never commit `.env.local`):

- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (required to answer).
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` (optional for chat; **required to index new preferred guides**
  via Extract. Enables supporting web search + guide picker).
- `SERPER_API_KEY` (optional; Serper.dev fallback when Tavily **Search** fails or
  is unconfigured — snippet-only, **does not** replace Tavily Extract for ingest).
- `REPLICATE_MODEL` (optional, default `google/gemini-2.5-flash`).
- `SUMOPOD_API_KEY` (required for preferred-guide RAG).
- `SUMOPOD_BASE_URL` (optional, default `https://ai.sumopod.com/v1`).
- `EMBED_MODEL` (optional, default `text-embedding-3-large`; preferred-guide
  RAG embedder. Swapping dims requires re-ingest).
- `LLM_LOG` (optional; `1` enables the `llm-log.json` model-call log in
  production — it is on automatically in dev). `LLM_LOG_PATH` overrides the path.
- `LLM_DB_LOG` (optional; `0` disables writes to `public.llm_calls`. On by default
  when Supabase vars are set — apply `db/llm-calls.sql` first. Insert-only RLS).
- `THEGAMESDB_API_KEY` (optional; enables game-name autocomplete + box art via
  TheGamesDB). Missing key => the field degrades to free text. IGDB (Twitch
  `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`) is the intended eventual upgrade but not wired now.
- `STEAM_API_KEY` (optional; Steam Web API key for owned-games library import after
  OpenID login, plus the persona name/avatar on Sign in with Steam). Missing key =>
  Connect Steam / Steam library stay hidden or no-op. User's Steam profile Game
  details must be Public.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional, server-only; NEVER expose via
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). Enables **Sign in with Steam** by minting a Supabase account for
  the Steam identity (`/api/steam/session`). Without it the bridge 501s and Steam
  stays a link-only action on a Google/email account.

Public client vars (safe to expose; protected by RLS), optional — enable
accounts, saved chats, and the search cache:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (publishable key).
  Project `GameGuideGuru` (ref `luoymycbpnvamdtlzjem`). Apply `db/guide-chunks.sql`
  and `db/embed-cache.sql` (pgvector extension) for preferred-guide RAG. Google OAuth and email
  confirmation are configured in the Supabase dashboard.

## Working conventions

- Keep model/search provider calls server-side; Supabase auth/DB reads are
  client-side under RLS (the anon key is public by design).
- Validate browser input and all external API data.
- Keep the UI accessible; the only runtime dependency is `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- No login wall: signed-out users must keep full access.
- Preserve source links alongside every generated guide.
- **CRITICAL LINTING RULE**: Setiap kali mengedit file React komponen (`.tsx`) atau TypeScript (`.ts`), Anda WAJIB menjalankan linter (misalnya melalui npm run lint atau mengecek *warning* pada IDE) dan memperbaiki semua error seperti pelanggaran *Rules of Hooks*, missing imports, dsb sebelum menyatakan tugas selesai kepada Tuan muda.
- Update this file when architecture, providers, commands, or environment
  requirements change significantly.

## Copywriting (brand voice)

All user-facing copy (buttons, labels, banners, toasts, empty states, alt text,
aria-labels, placeholders) follows this voice. It also applies to the model's
persona text in `lib/prompt.js`.

Voice: a helpful gaming buddy sitting next to you. Short, benefit-first, second
person, concrete. Calm and useful. Dry wit is fine. Never influencer hype, never
emoji spam, never panic urgency. English UI; the model still answers in the
player's language (Indonesian tone: relaxed, like chatting with a friend, "aku"
and "kamu", not stiff, no forced slang).

```
// BAD
"Unlock the ultimate guide — never get stuck again!"
"Oops! Something went wrong 😢"
"AI-powered answers to level up your gameplay"

// GOOD
"Stuck? Ask about any game and get a straight answer."
"Couldn't build a guide. Try again."
"Ask a follow-up and it remembers where you are."
```

Sound human, not like AI. Specifically avoid these tells:
- No em-dashes (`—`) or en-dashes as sentence punctuation (the clearest AI tell).
  Use a comma, period, parentheses, or "and"/"but". (En-dash `–` as a numeric or
  date *range* is fine; em-dashes inside code comments are fine.)
- No "it's not X, it's Y" / "not just X, but Y" constructions.
- No rule-of-three padding ("fast, simple, and reliable"), no "seamless",
  "effortless", "elevate", "unlock", "level up", "supercharge", "delve", "robust".
- Don't over-hedge or over-explain. Say the thing once.

- Admin Trace Dashboard: Created `/admin` route to monitor backend execution via `X-Trace-Id` tracking.

- Added `AutoRefresh` to Admin Dashboard for secure, background polling every 3 seconds.

- Refactored `/admin` route into a Realtime Client Component authenticated directly via Supabase for `ryansetiawan.works@gmail.com` only.

## Trace Audit Fixes (July 2026)

### Fix 1: Discovery Short-Circuit for Indexed Guides
- In `ingestGamefaqsBundle` (`lib/guide-ingest.ts`), added a `countBundleChunks` check before calling `discoverGamefaqsBundleResolved`. If chunks already exist for the bundle, skip discovery entirely and return `indexed: true` immediately.
- This eliminates 11+ wasted Tavily API calls per question on already-indexed guides (~23s and ~$0.11 saved per request).

### Fix 3: Full Trace Instrumentation
- **`lib/embed.ts`**: Added `embed_query_start`, `embed_query_end`, `embed_query_cache_hit`, `embed_texts_start`, `embed_texts_end` trace events. The 96-second black hole (embedding model cold start) is now fully visible.
- **`lib/gamefaqs-discover.ts`**: Added `discovery_cache_hit` and `discovery_cache_miss` trace events in `discoverGamefaqsBundleCacheFirst`.
- **`app/api/solve/route.ts`**: Added `generation_complete` trace event after answer generation.
- **`lib/guide-ingest.ts`**: Added `discovery_skipped` trace event when the short-circuit fires.
